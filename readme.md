# Offensive Language Classificator API

The project aims to create a simple API that will allow communication with a fine-tuned model and classifications of the type of tweets/posts - OFFENSIVE or NOT OFFENSIVE. While working on the project, an experiment tracking tool - [W&B](https://wandb.ai/) was used to track performance of the model. Model was trained using a GPU from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Results

On the validation set, the model achieved an accuracy of 81.57%, precision of 68.92
% and recall of 74.27%.
